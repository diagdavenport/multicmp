## multicmp

multicmp is a toolkit for flexible modeling of multivariate count data, especially in the presence of data dispersion. Currently the package only supports bivariate data. Future development will extend the package to higher-dimensional data.

[The two uses are for hypothesis testing of under/over-dispersion and parameter estimation?]

To use multicmp, one will first need to install the following two packages: 

```R
  install.packages("numDeriv")
  install.packages("stats")
````

One can install the latest released version of multicmp from CRAN with:

```R
  install.packages("multicmp")
````

## Using multicmp

To get started with multicmp right away, read the notes below. For a more detailed and technical description of the bivariate COMPoisson distribution, see [Sellers et al. (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2016.04.007).

The multicmp package houses the _accidents_ data set (Famoye and Consul, 1995)

[How exactly will we show the functions in action? The computations take a while on my machine. Is it worthwhile even to have an example here?]
